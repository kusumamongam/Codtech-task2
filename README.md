**Overview of the Project**

**Project: Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression**

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The goal is to predict the target variable based on one or more feature variables. We will split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Additionally, we will visualize the regression line and actual vs predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

**Key Activities:**

**Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.

**Splitting the data:** Split the data into training and tesing sets and train the model.

**Data Visualization:** Creating Visualization to predict the target based on one or more feature variables.

**Technologies used:**

**Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis.

**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis

**MAtplotlib:** Employed for creating stastic, animated, and interactive visualizations.

**Seaborn:** Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
